# Functions for encoding/decoding JSON. These wrappers are used in order
# to hide the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 implementations
# of the json module functions as well as instigate some better defaults
# for the handling on unknown objects. All but the first argument must
# be supplied as key word arguments to allow the wrappers to supply
# defaults.

    _kwargs = {}

    # This wrapper function needs to deal with a few issues.
    #
    # The first is that when a byte string is provided, we need to
    # ensure that it is interpreted as being Latin-1. This is necessary
    # as by default JSON will treat it as UTF-8, which means if an
    # invalid UTF-8 byte string is provided, a failure will occur when
    # encoding the value.
    #
    # The json.dumps() function in Python 2 had an encoding argument
    # which needs to be used to dictate what encoding a byte string
    # should be interpreted as being. We need to supply this and set it
    # to Latin-1 to avoid the failures if the byte string is not valid
    # UTF-8.
    #
    # For Python 3, it will simply fail if provided any byte string. To
    # be compatible with Python 2, we still want to accept them, but as
    # before interpret it as being Latin-1. For Python 3 we can only do
    # this by overriding the fallback encoder used when a type is
    # encountered that the JSON encoder doesn't know what to do with.
    #
    # The second issue we want to deal with is allowing generators or
    # iterables to be supplied and for them to be automatically expanded
    # and treated as lists. This also entails overriding the fallback
    # encoder.
    #
    # The third is eliminate white space after separators to trim the
    # size of the data being sent.
