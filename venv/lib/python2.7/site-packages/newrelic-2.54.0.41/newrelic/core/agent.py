class Agent(object):

    """Only one instance of the agent should ever exist and that can be
    obtained using the agent_instance() function.

    The licence key information, network connection details for the
    collector, plus whether SSL should be used is obtained directly from
    the global configuration settings. If a proxy has to be used, details
    for that will similarly come from the global configuration settings.

    The global configuration settings would normally be setup from the
    agent configuration file or could also be set explicitly. Direct access
    to global configuration setings prior to the agent instance being
    created needs to be via the 'newrelic.core.config' module.

    After the network connection details have been set, and the agent
    object created and accessed using the agent_instance() function, each
    individual reporting application can be activated using the
    activate_application() method of the agent. The name of the primary
    application and an optional list of linked applications to which metric
    data should also be reported needs to be supplied.

    Once an application has been activated and communications established
    with the core application, the application specific settings, which
    consists of the global default configuration settings overlaid with the
    server side configuration settings can be obtained using the
    application_settings() method. That a valid settings object rather than
    None is returned is the indicator that the application has been
    successfully activated. The application settings object can be
    associated with a transaction so that settings are available for the
    life of the transaction, but should not be cached and used across
    transactions. Instead the application settings object should be
    requested on each transaction to ensure that it is detected whether
    application is still active or not due to a server side triggered
    restart. When such a restart occurs, the application settings could
    change and thus why application settings cannot be cached beyond the
    lifetime of a single transaction.
