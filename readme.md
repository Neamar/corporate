## What's this ?
Corporate Game (CG) is a small, fun online game. Players compete to trade corporations assets, hoping to one day beat the market.

## Installation
This is a standard Django project. Check you meet all the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`, then run `./manage.py syncdb` to create the database.

Once you're done, run `./manage.py runserver` to get started on http://localhost:8000/.
